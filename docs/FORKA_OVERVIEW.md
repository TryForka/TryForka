# Forka: product and technical overview

What Forka is and how it works, drawn from the code (`src/`, `supabase/`) and the live Supabase project. Last refreshed 2026-10-15, after the finish-the-build pass (`docs/BUILD_PLAN.md`, `docs/BUILD_REPORT.md`).

## 1. What Forka is

Forka is a meal planner for busy families. It answers three questions for the parent at 5:30pm: what's for dinner, what to buy, and how to cook it.

The core loop:
1. **Set up the household once.** Diet, allergies, ingredients to skip, which meals to plan and the weeknight time limit. Onboarding and Settings write the same fields.
2. **Plan the week.** Suggestions picks a week from the recipe catalog, or you add recipes yourself from Build a meal plan. Every list is filtered for the household's allergies, diet and skipped ingredients in the database.
3. **Shop.** The grocery list builds itself from the week: amounts summed, sorted by aisle, staples tucked away.
4. **Cook.** The recipe page has US units, 1x/2x/3x scaling and timer chips. Cooking mode shows one step per screen and lets several timers run at once.
5. **Remember.** Favorites, collections, notes, ratings and a cooked log, all saved to the account.

## 2. Screens

All screens are in `src/screens/`, built from the design system in `src/components/ds/`. A dev-only reference is at `/styleguide`.

| Screen | File | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Sign up, Log in, Set a new password | `Auth.tsx` | Basil panel with a real week preview from the catalog. Outlined Google and Facebook buttons, which explain when a provider isn't turned on. Password reset by email. |
| Terms | `Terms.tsx` | Plain-language draft; needs legal review. |
| Onboarding | `Onboarding.tsx` | Four steps: diet, allergies, ingredients you skip, what to plan. |
| Meal plan (home) | `MealPlan.tsx` | Week strip (today marked in yolk), the Tonight hero, breakfast and lunch rows, rest of the week. Header buttons: Grocery list, New week plan, Browse recipes. |
| Suggestions | `SuggestionsPanel.tsx` | A sheet: free-text request, Find meals like a photo, Plan my whole week, starter chips. Swap mode replaces one day's slot. |
| Build a meal plan | `BrowseRecipes.tsx` | Filters, search, a camera button, and tiles; "+" adds a recipe to the next open slot. |
| Recipe | `RecipeDetail.tsx` | Hero photo, tags, allergen warnings, Ingredients/Steps toggle, scaling, timer chips, TheMealDB credit, Start cooking and Mark as cooked. |
| Cooking mode | `CookingMode.tsx` | "Step n of N", arrow and space keys, keeps the screen awake. Done marks the recipe as cooked, then offers a rating. |
| Notes, Rate this recipe, Add to collection | `Notes.tsx`, `RateRecipe.tsx`, `Collections.tsx` | Notes autosave. Ratings go to `recipe_ratings`. |
| Favorites | `Favorites.tsx` | Favorites and Collections tabs; collections open to their recipes. |
| Groceries | `Groceries.tsx` | Aisles, a "Got it" section per aisle, "Probably have it", add your own items, copy and share. The Instacart button is a placeholder. |
| Settings | `Settings.tsx` | Household, allergies, diet, ingredients we skip, planning, units, account (photo, sign out, delete), About. Saves as you go. |
| Photo search | `PhotoSearch.tsx` | Take or choose a photo, add an optional description, get 6 to 8 similar recipes. |

Navigation is a `currentScreen` state machine with a back stack in `src/App.tsx`. Shared state (session, preferences, week plan, favorites) is in `src/app/AppContext.tsx`. Below 768px a 56px bottom tab bar replaces the sidebar. Running timers float in a tray on every screen (`src/components/Timers.tsx`).

## 3. Stack

- Vite, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind v4. Tokens are in `src/index.css`. Fonts are Bricolage Grotesque and Figtree; icons are `lucide-react`.
- Supabase: auth, Postgres with row-level security, Edge Functions (Deno), storage for avatars, and pg_cron with pg_net for the weekly sync.
- Claude Haiku 4.5 (`claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`, overridable with the `CLAUDE_MODEL` secret), called only from Edge Functions.
- TheMealDB as the recipe source, copied into Supabase. Their terms allow it, with credit.
- Hosting: Vercel (static build).

## 4. Recipe catalog

`recipes` and `ingredient_meta` are filled by the `sync-recipes` Edge Function. It runs weekly through pg_cron, or by hand:

```sh
curl -X POST https://akufkhzzqwjhssmegvof.supabase.co/functions/v1/sync-recipes \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "x-sync-secret: <SYNC_SECRET>" -d '{"step":"all"}'
```

The steps are:
- `fetch`: every meal from TheMealDB, using `MEALDB_API_KEY`. Each meal is converted with the shared helpers in `supabase/functions/_shared/catalog/`:
  - Steps are split, with timers labeled from the wording ("Soak 30 min").
  - Ingredients are parsed into quantity, unit and note.
  - Text gets US names and units: 400°F, 2 lb, eggplant.
  - Allergens and diets are found from ingredients, the recipe name and the instructions.
- `classify`: Claude sets the meal role, display name, subtitle and an estimated total time, only for rows that don't have them yet. A recipe is never classified twice.
- `aisles`: Claude sorts any new ingredient names into grocery aisles.
- `names`: tidies display names (US words, sentence case).
- `subtitles` (manual): rewrites subtitles from each recipe's own ingredients.

Unit tests for all of this run with `npm test`.

## 5. Data model

Every user table has row-level security that allows owners only, and is removed when the account is deleted.

- **Household settings:**
  - `user_preferences`: diet, allergies (the 9 keys), ingredients to skip, which meals to plan, weeknight time limit, units, onboarding date. The older onboarding columns are kept but no longer used.
  - `users`: name, household name and size.
- **Plans and shopping:**
  - `week_plans`: one per user, with weekday keys and dates planned and last edited.
  - `grocery_lists`: items, ticked items, items added by hand, and which plan version the list was built from.
- **Recipe history:** `favorites`, `collections` with `collection_recipes`, `notes`, `recipe_ratings` (the old `feedback` table is kept, copied over), and `cooked_recipes`.
- **Photo search and rate limits:**
  - `dish_lookups`: what the photo was identified as. The image itself is never stored.
  - `ai_requests` and `claim_request(kind, per_minute, per_day)`: per-user limits.
- **Catalog:** `recipes` and `ingredient_meta` are readable by everyone, but only the server can write to them.
- **`safe_recipes()`:** the database function every recipe list uses. It removes recipes with the caller's allergens, recipes that don't fit their diet, and recipes using ingredients they skip.

## 6. Edge Functions

| Function | Auth | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `ai-suggestions` | user JWT | `suggestions`: Claude picks 6 to 8 recipe ids from the user's safe list; it's told what's filtered and never claims an allergen. `week`: plans the enabled meals for 7 days and checks the weeknight time limit and repeats. Limit 5 per minute, 50 per day. |
| `analyze-dish` | user JWT | Photo plus optional description goes to Haiku vision, which describes the dish through a tool call. Results are scored against the safe catalog and logged in `dish_lookups`. Limit 20 per day. |
| `delete-account` | user JWT | Deletes the user's avatar files, then the auth user. Every table cascades. |
| `sync-recipes` | `x-sync-secret` | The catalog sync (see section 4). Deployed with `--no-verify-jwt`. |

Secrets: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_WORKSPACE_ID`, `SYNC_SECRET`, `MEALDB_API_KEY` (optional; defaults to the test key), `CLAUDE_MODEL` (optional). Vault holds `project_url` and `sync_recipes_secret` for the cron job.

## 7. Allergies

Allergies are a hard filter at every point a recipe can reach the user: browse, search, week plans, suggestions, swaps and photo results. They all read from `safe_recipes()`.

Matching over-flags on purpose: ingredient names, the recipe name and the instructions are all checked. A single recipe still opens from a favorite even after an allergy is added, with a warning in the alert color.

Ingredient lists from TheMealDB can be incomplete. The terms page tells users to check labels.
